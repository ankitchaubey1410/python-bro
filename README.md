## 🌿 Philosophy

**Python Little Aesthetics** is about writing code that *feels good to read*.  
Not complex. Not heavy. Just **simple, soft, and elegant**.

We follow the quiet beauty of Python:

- Simple is better than complex  
- Readable is better than clever  
- Minimal is better than crowded  
- Beauty lives in small details  

> **Beautiful is better than ugly.**
